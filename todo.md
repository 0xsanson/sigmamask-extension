 - permission request should be single step and pick the first networkclick out of the bunch
 - permission structure should be a set of chain ids not just 1
 - add ethereum chain should set permission as well
 - manual clearing of permissions should clear switch permission
 - Make a ticket to investiage the idea of overloading addEthereumChain to save the network client as a dapp selection
